### Create Windows 10 (Win10) autounattend Single ISO on Windows Worker

The Windows worker can run Linux commands using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

### Create Windows autounattend WinPE ISO on Windows Worker


### Create Windows Server 2016 (Win2016) autounattend Dual ISO on Windows Worker


### Create Windows Server 2016 (Win2016) autounattend Single ISO on Windows Worker


### Create Windows Server 2019 (Win2019) autounattend Dual ISO on Windows Worker


### Create Windows Server 2019 (Win2019) autounattend Single ISO on Windows Worker


### Create Windows Server 2022 (Win2022) autounattend Dual ISO on Windows Worker


### Create Windows Server 2022 (Win2022) autounattend Single ISO on Windows Worker


### Deploy and Extract Win10 ISO to Smb Share on Windows


### Deploy and Extract Win11 ISO to Smb Share on Windows


### Deploy and Extract Win2016 ISO to Smb Share on Windows


### Deploy and Extract Win2019 ISO to Smb Share on Windows


### Deploy and Extract Win2022 ISO to Smb Share on Windows


### Deploy and Mount Win2022 ISO To Node for Feature Install on Windows


### Perform Test Win Node

Performs basic tests for the built node.

### Unmount and Remove ISO From Node for Feature Install on Windows


### WinPE Essentials Extraction on Windows

Sets up the "plain" WinPE skeleton files on Windows Worker at `C:\WinPE_amd64`.

This folder can be copied and then it's `.\media\sources\boot.wim` file can be modified for an automated unattended Windows install.

This folder works for both BIOS and UEFI boot methods.

### Create Windows 11 Workstation (Win11) autounattend Single ISO on Windows Worker

The Windows worker can run Linux commands using Windows Subsystem for Linux.
